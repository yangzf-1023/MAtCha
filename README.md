MAtCha Gaussians reconstruction from 10 input views.<br><br>
</b>
<b> We propose MAtCha Gaussians, a novel surface representation for reconstructing high-quality 3D meshes with photorealistic rendering from sparse-view (or dense-view) images. Our key idea is to model the underlying scene geometry as an Atlas of Charts which we refine with <a href="https://surfsplatting.github.io/">2D Gaussian surfels</a>.

</div>

This repository proposes the following key elements:
- **Optimization robust to sparse-view inputs:** Our novel initialization/optimization pipeline is robust to sparse-view inputs (as few as 3 to 10 images) but also scales to dense-view scenarios (hundreds of views). No more choosing between sparse or dense methods!
- **Scalable mesh extraction method:** We developed a new mesh extraction method that properly handles both foreground and background geometry while being lightweight (only 150-350MB), without any post-processing mesh decimation.
- **Novel depth regularization:** We also introduce a novel regularization loss that leverages depth maps estimated with a monocular depth estimator (which can be multi-view inconsistent or have inaccurate scale) to achieve smooth, detailed background geometry while preserving very sharp foreground details.

<!-- ## Abstract

_We present a novel appearance model that simultaneously realizes explicit high-quality 3D surface mesh recovery and photorealistic novel view synthesis from sparse view samples.
Our key idea is to model the underlying scene geometry Mesh as an Atlas of Charts which we render with 2D Gaussian surfels (MAtCha Gaussians).
MAtCha distills high-frequency scene surface details from an off-the-shelf monocular depth estimator and refines it through <a href="https://surfsplatting.github.io/">2D Gaussian surfel rendering</a>. The Gaussian surfels are attached to the charts on the fly, satisfying photorealism of neural volumetric rendering and crisp geometry of a mesh model, i.e., two seemingly contradicting goals in a single model.
At the core of MAtCha lies a novel neural deformation model and a structure loss that preserve the fine surface details distilled from learned monocular depths while addressing their fundamental scale ambiguities.
Results of extensive experimental validation demonstrate MAtCha's state-of-the-art quality of surface reconstruction and photorealism on-par with top contenders but with dramatic reduction in the number of input views and computational time.
We believe MAtCha will serve as a foundational tool for any visual application in vision, graphics, and robotics that require explicit geometry in addition to photorealism._ -->

## Overview

The full MAtCha pipeline consists of 4 steps:
1. **Scene initialization**: Camera poses are estimated from a sparse set of images using <a href="https://europe.naverlabs.com/research/publications/mast3r-sfm-a-fully-integrated-solution-for-unconstrained-structure-from-motion/">MASt3R-SfM</a>. Images can be unposed or posed. For posed images, a COLMAP dataset with ground truth camera poses can be provided to the pipeline. For COLMAP datasets, MAtCha can use either sparse or dense viewpoints.
2. **Chart Alignment**: Each input image is converted into an optimizable chart. We first initialize the charts with <a href="https://depth-anything-v2.github.io/">DepthAnythingV2</a>. Then, we use a novel neural deformation model to align the chart with the scene geometry and produce a multi-view consistent, coherent manifold.
3. **Chart refinement**: We further refine and densify the geometry with a photometric optimization. To this end, we instantiate <a href="https://surfsplatting.github.io/">2D Gaussians</a> aligned with the manifold and optimize the representation with differentiable rendering. Gaussians can densify along the manifold to better capture the fine details of the scene.
4. **Mesh extraction**: We propose a novel mesh extraction method that relies on a depth fusion algorithm and an adaptive tetrahedralization of the scene. Our mesh extraction method scales to large scenes with background objects, allowing for a much more flexible and adaptive mesh with detailed foreground objects and smooth background geometry.

We provide a dedicated script for each of these steps, as well as a script `train.py` that runs the entire pipeline. We explain how to use this script in the next sections. <br>

## Quick Start

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Click here to see content.</span></summary>

This section describes how to run the full MAtCha pipeline on a set of unposed or posed images, with either sparse or dense supervision. For running only specific steps of the pipeline, please refer to the following section. Please make sure to first activate the conda environment created by the installation script:

```shell
conda activate matcha
```

<!-- ### Training on unposed images -->

<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Training on unposed images with sparse supervision</span></summary>

You can run the following single script to optimize a full MAtCha model using a set of unposed images. By default, all images in the directory will be used:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed
```

You can select a subset of images to use for the optimization. To this end, you can either use the `--image_idx` argument to select a specific subset of images by index, or the `--n_images` argument to select a fixed number of images. If using the `--n_images` argument, the images will be sampled with constant spacing; You can add the `--randomize_images` argument to shuffle the images before sampling.

To use a specific subset of images (such as the first 5 images in the directory), you can run:
```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --image_idx 0 1 2 3 4
```

To use 10 images sampled with constant spacing in the directory, you can run:
```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --n_images 10
```

To use 10 images randomly sampled in the directory, you can run:
```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --n_images 10 --randomize_images
```

</details>

<!-- ### Training on posed images (COLMAP dataset) with sparse supervision -->
<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Training on COLMAP dataset with sparse supervision</span></summary>

You can also provide a usual COLMAP dataset with ground truth camera poses to MAtCha by using the `--sfm_config posed` argument. In this case, as COLMAP datasets may contain a large number of images, make sure to provide the indices of the images to use for the optimization with the `--image_idx` argument, or to use the `--n_images` argument. For instance, to use only the first 5 images for sparse-view reconstruction, you can run:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO COLMAP DATASET> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config posed --image_idx 0 1 2 3 4
```

You can create a COLMAP dataset from a set of images using the script `2d-gaussian-splatting/convert.py`. Please refer to the repo of our previous work <a href="https://github.com/Anttwo/SuGaR">SuGaR</a> or the <a href="https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting">original 3DGS repo</a> for more details on how to do this.

</details>

<!-- ### Training on posed images (COLMAP dataset) with dense supervision -->
<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Training on COLMAP dataset with dense supervision</span></summary>

You can also provide a usual COLMAP dataset with ground truth camera poses and dense viewpoints to MAtCha by using both the `--sfm_config posed` and `--dense_supervision` arguments. 
In this case, a subset of images will first be converted into charts for building an initial manifold; The manifold will then be used as a scaffold for optimizing the full model with dense supervision, using all the images in the dataset. We recommend selecting a subset of images with good coverage of the scene for building the initial charts.

We also provide a novel loss function for regularizing the representation using depth maps for all viewpoints obtained with a monocular depth estimator. Our novel loss function enforces the rendered depth maps to preserve the same depth order as the supervision depth maps; As a result, it does not require supervision depth maps to be multi-view consistent and does not require any additional alignment or rescaling of the depth maps. 

You do not need to provide the supervision depth maps to the pipeline, as our code will automatically use DepthAnythingV2 to generate them.

Make sure to provide the indices of the images to use as initial charts with the `--image_idx` argument, or to use the `--n_images` argument. For instance, to use 10 images with constant spacing as initial charts for dense-view reconstruction, you can run:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO COLMAP DATASET> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config posed --dense_supervision --n_images 10
```

By default, the train.py script will optimize the model for 30,000 iterations when using dense supervision, instead of the default 7,000 iterations used for sparse-view reconstruction. You can change this behavior by using the argument `--free_gaussians_config default` to optimize for 7,000 iterations, or `--free_gaussians_config long` to optimize for 30,000 iterations. 
While optimizing for 30,000 iterations will take approximately 50 minutes in total, optimizing for 7,000 iterations will take a few minutes only. However, for dense-view reconstruction, we recommend optimizing for 30,000 iterations to ensure optimal quality.

</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Running specific steps of the pipeline</span></summary>

You can run only one specific step of the pipeline by using one of the following arguments with the `train.py` script:

- `--sfm_only`: Only run the scene initialization using MASt3R-SfM.
- `--alignment_only`: Only run the chart alignment using our novel neural deformation model.
- `--refinement_only`: Only run the chart refinement using 2D Gaussians.
- `--mesh_only`: Only run the mesh extraction relying on our custom and scalable depth fusion algorithm.

Running a specific step can be useful for experimenting with different hyperparameters, adjusting the strength of the regularization during chart alignment and refinement, trying different resolution for extracting the final mesh, etc.

You can also combine several of these arguments to run several specific steps in a single run.

The full training script `train.py` is just a wrapper around individual scripts located in the `./scripts/` directory; Please refer to these scripts for more details on how to use them as well as the different arguments.

</details>

<!-- ### Stronger regularization for removing floaters -->
<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Stronger regularization for removing floaters</span></summary>

If some artifacts or floaters are present in the final mesh, you can try to increase the strength of the chart alignment with `--alignment_config strong`:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --n_images 10 --alignment_config strong
```

If using a COLMAP dataset with dense supervision, you can also adjust the strength of the dense depth regularization with the `--dense_regul` argument: 

- Use `--dense_regul default` for the default regularization
- Use `--dense_regul strong` for a stronger regularization
- Use `--dense_regul weak` for a weaker regularization
- Use `--dense_regul none` to disable the dense regularization.

Increasing the strength of the dense depth regularization can help removing floaters. For some specific scenes where GT camera poses or monocular depth maps could be inaccurate and contain outliers, the dense depth regularization could be detrimental; In this case, you can also try to weaken or disable the dense depth regularization.

For instance, to use 10 initial charts generated from 10 images with constant spacing and perform dense-view reconstruction with a stronger dense depth regularization, you can run:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO COLMAP DATASET> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config posed --dense_supervision --n_images 10 --dense_regul strong
```

</details>

<!-- ### Mesh extraction -->
<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Improve Mesh Quality</span></summary>

Our novel mesh extraction method relies on a custom depth fusion algorithm. To scale our method to large scenes with background objects, we adapted the adaptive tetrahedralization method from <a href="https://niujinshuchong.github.io/gaussian-opacity-fields/">Gaussian Opacity Fields (GOF)</a>: We partition the scene into a set of tetrahedra, such that the local number of tetrahedra directly depends on the local distribution of Gaussians in the scene. This allows for a much more flexible and adaptive mesh with both detailed foreground objects and smooth background geometry.

For dense-view reconstruction, we iterate over all training viewpoints to extract the final mesh.

For sparse-view reconstruction, we linearly interpolate pseudo-viewpoints between the neighboring sparse training viewpoints to extract the final mesh. However, in some cases, interpolating pseudo-viewpoints could lead to artifacts in the mesh, especially if interpolated viewpoints end up being inside the geometry.

If encountering such artifacts, you can try to disable the interpolation with the `--no_interpolated_views` argument:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --n_images 10 --no_interpolated_views
```

Please note that we also propose a multi-resolution TSDF fusion method that can be used instead of the adaptive tetrahedralization method. While this method is closer to concurrent works, it may produce artifacts or large holes in the mesh; As a result, we strongly recommend using the adaptive tetrahedralization method for better quality meshes. For using the multi-resolution TSDF fusion method, you can use the `--use_multires_tsdf` argument:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --n_images 10 --use_multires_tsdf
```

</details>

<br>
<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Control the resolution of the final mesh</span></summary>

When using the adaptive tetrahedralization method, you can control the downsampling ratio of the tetrahedra set with the `--tetra_downsample_ratio` argument. This parameter directly controls the number of vertices in the final mesh.

We recommend starting with the default value of `--tetra_downsample_ratio 0.5` and then decreasing to `0.25` if the mesh is too dense, or increasing to `1.0` if the mesh is too sparse.

For example, to use a downsampling ratio of `0.25` with a dataset of unposed images, you can run:

```shell
python train.py -s <PATH TO IMAGE DIRECTORY> -o <PATH TO OUTPUT DIRECTORY> --sfm_config unposed --tetra_downsample_ratio 0.25
```

</details>

Please refer to the `train.py` script as well as individual scripts in the `./scripts/` directory for more details on the command line arguments. Feel free to modify the config files in the `./configs/` directory or create your own to suit your needs.

| `--texture_square_size` | `int` | Size of the square allocated to each pair of triangles in the UV texture. Increase for higher texture resolution. Please decrease if you encounter memory issues. Default is `8`. |
|`--white_background` | `bool` | If True, the background of the images will be set to white. Default is `False`. |

## Evaluation

<details>
<summary><span style="font-weight: bold;">Click here to see content.</span></summary><br>

We will release the evaluation scripts soon, including:
- Surface reconstruction on DTU
- Surface reconstruction on Tanks and Temples
- Novel view synthesis on Mip-NeRF 360, Tanks and Temples and DeepBlending

We still need to clean the codebase a little bit and merge some scripts to make the full evaluation pipeline easier to run.
